 Optimization-Landscape-of-Teacher-Student-Problems

 In this repository we gathered code for computing a data distribution induced inner product discriminant (focal locus) in the case of $2\times 2$ matrices:
1. Algebraic_Description_of_the_Discriminant provides the derivation of the ideal with appropriate algorithms;
2. Dense_Data_Discriminant_Code provides the code;
3. Dense_discriminant provides the equation of the discriminant;

Additionally, Tensor_ED_Discriminant provides the code for the discriminant with respect to the Frobenius norm of a $2\times2\times 2$ rank-1 tensor.
